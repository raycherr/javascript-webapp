## About Project

This is a responsive web application that uses vanilla javascript, with no bundlers or CSS framework.

The web app features two pages:
1. A list of posts from JSONPlaceholder API
2. Play audio samples using Web Audio API

The UI also follows Google Material standards for a clean look. 

## Getting Started

1. Clone repository

```
git clone https://github.com/raycherr/javascript-webapp.git
```

2. Open index.html in a web browser

3. Click on the tabs 'Posts' and 'Audio' to browse the two pages
